# WELLness
Wellness is an app for students at Wellesley College to better incorporate wellness into their daily lives. The app takes data from pre-existing Google Calendars in order to personalize the optimal times to practice wellness and self-care activities. Additionally, the app allows the user to define what wellness means to them - exercise, meditation, sleep, etcetera. The system tracks user-provided mood data, sleep habits, and wellness time in order to allow for data collection and self-reflection. The Wellness app uses a push notification system to provide reminders for practicing wellness as well as feedback on user habits and behavior.
