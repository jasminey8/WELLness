		<h3><u>Technical Specifications</u></h3>
		<h4>Internal Consistency: </h4>
		<p>One way the design manifests consistency is through the navigation bar at the top of each page and a tab bar at the bottom of each page. Additionally, the navigation bar at the top of the page consistently displays the title of the tab that the user is on. </p>
		

		
		<h4>Color and Typography:</h4>
		<p>We chose a simple sans-serif font that is legible and serves to enhance readability.</p>
		<center>
			<img src="Images/WriteupImage.png" class="img-fluid">
   		</center>
		
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<h4>External Consistency: </h4>
		<p>We use icons and images that are commonly used in other mobile applications. </p>
		

		
		<h4>Incorporation of Existing Habits:</h4>
		<p>Wellness strives to minimize extra time input and work for the user by incorporating Google Calendar, which is a program that the user ideally already has and utilizes. In this way, Wellness seamlessly incorporates its wellness program into the user’s life. </p>
		

		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
		<h3><u>Collaboration Process</u></h3>
		<p>Overall, the process for completing this portion of the project took approximately two weeks. First, it began with a meeting, where we allocated work by html files for separate web pages of the prototype. We followed the model-view controller pattern of dividing the work into developing the model, controller, and views separately. We took several days completing the html code for separate pages before we reconvened. At our next meeting, we linked a master css stylesheet to each page. Afterwards we had several more meetings where we did simultaneous development for working on the html, css, and javascript. In between the group meetings, we worked on individual development, but the group meetings were extremely helpful to check in, help each other with coding issues, and make sure we were all on the same page conceptually.</p>
		<p>The major challenge that we faced was in situations where we were focusing on one html page at a time. It was extremely time consuming and at times, confusing, for multiple people to try to make several changes to one html page. We were so used to the convenience of Google Drive, where multiple people can view and edit a document at the same time, so the process we had to use with cyberduck and group-coding felt like a step backwards. </p>
		<p>Despite our minor frustration with the limits of modern coding technology, overall we are satisfied with our collaboration process and feel that we have honored our contract. </p>

		<h3><u>Prototype Note</u></h3>
		<p>A few detailed functions to note about our prototype include the action of adjusting the targets and the Check-Ins page.</p>
		<h4>Saving Targets and Seeing Wellness Slots in Calendar:</h4>
		<p>When the user selects and saves any specifications in the Targets page of our prototype, a “Saved!” text feedback appears below the Save button. After saving the target specifications, if the user goes to the Calendar page, she will see new added wellness time slots in pink on her calendar. Ideally in the finished product, the length, frequency, and type of wellness activity of these time slots should be dependent on the customized targets specifications that the user had input in the Targets page. In our prototype, we kept a general wellness time slot that does not include these specific, customized characteristics.</p>
		<h4>Check-Ins Emojis and Graph:</h4>
		<p>In the ideal finished product, the user should be able to click on the emoji that best represents how she is feeling in the Check-Ins page, and after clicking on the emoji, the graph below should update accordingly. In our prototype, we only showed the functionality of clicking the first two emojis: the sad emoji and open-mouth smiling/happy emoji. After clicking on one of these two emojis, the graph at the bottom updates. The user also can click the undo button if they accidentally clicked the wrong emoji, reverting the graph.</p>
