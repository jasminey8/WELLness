			<h2 id="designdirectiontext">Design Direction</h2>
			<p>In P2, the two manifestations of our product of including wellness into the daily lives of Wellesley Students were a desktop website version and a phone app version. Ultimately, it became a decision of which device to use: a computer or a phone. We chose the phone app version for our design. This decision was propelled by several reasons, including the Notifications feature of the smartphone, the users’ common environments, and the users’ pre-existing habits. The app’s mission is to incorporate wellness activities into Wellesley Students’ schedules, and does so by analyzing their pre-existing Google or Apple Calendar that they use to schedule their daily activities. The Notifications feature that is common in all smartphones that would benefit the purposes of the app, in that it could easily and efficiently remind the user to practice wellness. The smartphone is always on hand compared to a laptop or desktop computer, so this notifications feature is crucial to including wellness into a user’s day. The Environments of the users and their Pre-existing Habits were also taken into account. The users are usually in environments where they will have their smartphones on hand (walking to class, in class, at meals, in meetings, etc.), whereas situations where they will have computers is less likely. Additionally, most users we interviewed and received feedback from had pre-existing habits of calendaring, which we built our functionality off of, and usually use their phone to reference their calendars.</p>
			<p>We added several improvements to our design that incorporated feedback we received regarding the prototype. One issue that was raised pertained to the thoroughness of information provided by the Calendar schedule, as students mentioned circumstances where the user may be participating in an activity that is not listed in their Calendaring app information. If the user receives a notification to engage in a wellness activity while they are busy, the system may cause added stress due to the user’s inability to respond to the command of engaging in wellness. In order to account for these circumstances and reduce the possibility of added pressures, we changed the wellness break suggestions to be phrased as questions rather than imperatives. We added a feature that allows users a choice to respond to a wellness break notification with either a “Yes” or “Later” button. Pressing the “Later” button stalls the notification to a later time. With these changes, we intend to present notifications as gentle suggestions and reminders rather than cumbersome commands.</p>

			<h2 id="riskypartstext">Risky Parts</h2>
			<h3 id="risky1">1. A user does not calendar using Google or Apple calendar</h3>
			<p>The first and foremost risk for our app, that was brought up as feedback from our prototype workshop in class, was the possibility of a user who was interested in incorporating wellness into their lives, but did not calendar using Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, or any calendar at all. In this case, the solution our team has developed is to continue to add wellness activities, but randomly on a blank calendar, and notify the user multiple times throughout the day. This increases the chance for error, which would be notifying the user at a time that is inopportune for them to practice wellness. It also decreases satisfaction, as the times chosen will be random.</p>
			<h3 id="risky2">2. A user does not calendar ALL of their activities on their calendaring app</h3>
			<p>Another risk for our app is the possibility that a user who does use a calendaring app to not necessarily input all of their activities on the calendar. Our solution, as outlined before, was adding an option to delay the wellness activity, should the notification come at an inopportune time. Even with the solution, however, there is a risk for decreased satisfaction, as users may constantly delay and ultimately not practice wellness, or be annoyed by the fact that the notification came during a meeting.</p>

			<h3 id="briefing">Briefing:</h3>
			<p>This is an app intended for Wellesley students to incorporate wellness into their hectic schedules. The way that this is accomplished is through linking your Google calendar to the program so that it can automatically insert “wellness breaks” into your free time. Users can specify features of these wellness breaks, including the activity, daily frequency, and length of the break. The app also provides feedback based on the user’s check-in, and it tracks the user’s sleep data and mood.</p>
			<h3 id="notecard">Notecard Tasks:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Find Targets page and modify your wellness goals</li>
				<li>Check-in with the program and select how you’re feeling</li>
				<li>Change your settings for the app based on your preferences</li>
				<li>Find the calendar and identify when your wellness breaks are scheduled</li>
			</ul>

				<h3 id="sumobservations">Summary of Observations:</h3>
				<p>In general, our app was intuitive for most users without any need for instructions, and they all enjoyed the functionality of our app. The users were consistently able to identify the signifiers in the menu bar at the bottom of the screen due to familiar external consistency, easily being able to navigate to different panels on the app without hesitation. When viewing the calendar, all quickly identified the wellness breaks. On the Targets page, all understood that they could customize their wellness goals by clicking on each option, even if they learned by doing. One feedback we received from User 2 is that it would be nice to enter the user’s own type of break in addition to selecting from a drop-down menu. Therefore, we are incorporating an “other” option in the drop-down menu of our second prototype which would then allow the user to type in her own break. The graphs associated with the Targets page and the Check-Ins page were mostly understandable without explanation and considered to be highly useful. We received the most feedback regarding the variety of emojis available to choose from in the Check-Ins page. All wanted more emojis, including a neutral emoji and another happy emoji, which we therefore are including in our second prototype. When asked if some of the emojis seemed confusing, all said no even though some hesitated on a few when looking through the emojis. There was also slight hesitation on the Messages page’s utilization when viewing the Messages page at first, but after reading the example messages, all users were able to correctly identify that it is a chatbot. To mitigate any potential confusion, we have decided to have the first message in the Messages page be a brief explanation for the purpose of the messages.</p>

				<h3 id="designchoices">Design Choices Made from Observations:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>More Emojis (happier): Sarah</li>
					<li>Neutral Emoji: Raven</li>
					<li>Larger text size</li>
					<li>The first message in the Messages page is a tutorial that says, “This is a bot that provides encouraging feedback…”</li>
					<li>User can enter own type of break</li>
					<li>Include option in settings to turn off notifications/messages</li>
				</ul>
