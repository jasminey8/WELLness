  		<h2><strong>Personas</strong></h2>
  		<p>After our interviews from P1 and P2 and creating empathy maps (we created them here in P2 after our P2 interviews because we did them wrong in our P1. Please see our short explanation in red in P1), we decided to create two personas based on common behavioral patterns: those who are dedicated to improving their wellness, and those who are stressed and tired with a lack of dedication to prioritizing wellness.</p>	
		
  		<h3><u>Contextual Inquiry Interview #1</u></h3>  		
  		<p><strong><em>Background</em></strong></p>
  		<p>Jenny is a first-year student excited to try new things and happy to be at Wellesley College. She lives on the first floor of Shafer, a dorm in the Residential Quad, where she is surrounded by other first-years who comprise most of her friend group. Her social circles are made up of people she shares extracurriculars with, such as the Squash Team, Wellesley Civic Engagement volunteering, and a Biology Research Group. In terms of academics, she is undeclared at the moment, but is exploring the possibility of majoring in Neuroscience or Computer Science. </p>
  		
  		<p><strong><em>Average Day</em></strong></p>
  		<p>Jenny wakes up at 6am three times a week to go to squash practice. On other days, she normally wakes up at 8am. She always makes sure she gets at least 8 hours of sleep, which she is able to do because of her balanced schedule. After practice, she eats breakfast and goes to class. She has a yoga PE class twice a week, which she uses to destress. After her commitments, Jenny finds her friends and spends time with them, sometimes even doing homework with them. Three times a week she goes to her Biology Research Group. On weekends, Jenny either has a squash match, volunteering, or free time to spend time with friends or get ahead on homework.</p>
  		
  		<p><strong><em>Technology Use</em></strong></p>
  		<p>Jenny relies on her laptop and smartphone similarly to other students, using them for class assignments, calendaring, reminders, and social media among other things. As a potential CS major Jenny uses her laptop a bit longer in order complete problem sets. Additionally, Jenny is invested in her physical health and has a smartwatch, a FitBit to be exact.</p>
  		
  		<p><strong><em>Goals</em></strong></p>
  		<p>Jenny’s main priorities have to do with basic needs. She cares about her physical health and mental health primarily, supporting these goals with sports, yoga, friends, and other relaxing activities. As a first-year she is not yet concerned about finding a job, summer internship, or gaining leadership positions. She is able to reach her goals at the moment, so another main goal would be to maintain her standard of living.</p>

  		<h3><u>Contextual Inquiry Interview #2</u></h3> 		
  		<p><strong><em>Background</em></strong></p>
  		<p>Marie is a second-year student at Wellesley College majoring in biology and minoring in health & society. She is from Shrewsbury, Massachusetts and is of Japanese descent. She has a younger brother, and can speak Japanese, French, and English. She lives in a triple room with two other roommates in Severance Hall. She is close with her roommates and is satisfied with her dorm location. Her course load includes 4 classes, one of which is conducting biology research at Wellesley. She is highly involved as an e-board member in three clubs and as an orientation coordinator. As a Balance Health Educator, she recognizes the importance of self-care and healthy habits. She also works in the child care center twice a week, which she finds to be relaxing. Marie was originally planning to take 5 classes, but just last week, she dropped a class because she felt overwhelmed by all the work she had to do. She feels stressed around 2-3 times a week.</p> 
		<p>In her free time, Marie enjoys listening to music, doodling, going out to Boston, running, and hanging out with friends. She is extroverted, and is currently seeing someone off-campus. Developing and maintaining a long-term relationship is important to her.</p>
  		
  		<p><strong><em>Average Day</em></strong></p>
		<p>Marie’s day usually starts at 7:30 am. She attends classes in the morning or the afternoon. She works and attends student organization meetings in the afternoon and evening. Later in the day she studies, hangs out with friends, and conducts research. She expresses that she is satisfied by the fact that she gets around 8 hours of sleep per night.</p> 
		 		
  		<p><strong><em>Technology Use</em></strong></p>
  		<p>Marie is well-versed in social media, and frequently uses her MacBook and iPhone for doing homework, connecting with friends, and for entertainment purposes. She heavily relies on Google Calendar to plan out her daily and weekly schedules, documenting all her classes, activities, meetings, and events.</p>
  		
  		<p><strong><em>Goals</em></strong></p>
  		<p>Marie has ambitions of getting into medical school and becoming a doctor. Additionally, she is interested in maintaining good grades. She believes that self-care is extremely important and will positively impact her stress levels, and feels that now that she has dropped a class she can prioritize and take more time for wellness. She also has personal goals of maintaining a happy relationship with her parents. </p>

  		<h3><u>Contextual Inquiry Interview #3</u></h3>	
  		<p><strong><em>Background</em></strong></p>
  		<p>Athena is a junior at Wellesley College majoring in economics and music and minoring in astronomy. She grew up in the Boston area with her older sister and is fluent in Chinese and English. She lives in a single in Tower. Due to her adventurous spirit, she is involved in multiple clubs on campus such as the Wellesley Consulting Club and Chamber Music Society. The Consulting Club is beneficial for her because she wants to be a consultant after graduation, and Chamber Music Society enables her to channel her artistic talents. She is taking 5 classes this semester, making her stressed on about 5 days of the week. Understanding the importance of a junior year internship, she luckily has already found an internship for this summer. She states that if she was still currently looking for an internship, she would be even way more stressed. To mediate her stress levels, she routinely goes to a therapist.</p>
  		<p>In her free time, Athena enjoys going out with her friends to Boston or simply sleeping. It is important for her to hang out with friends on the weekends or during lunch.</p>
  		
  		<p><strong><em>Average Day</em></strong></p>
  		<p>On an average day, she attends her classes, studies with friends, and attends music practice. Some of her classes are at MIT from 7pm to 10pm, so she does not get back to Wellesley until 11pm for two days out of the week. As a result of this vigorous schedule, she only gets about 6 hours of sleep each night when she ideally would like 8 hours.</p>
		 		
  		<p><strong><em>Technology Use</em></strong></p>
  		<p>Athena relies heavily on her Mac laptop and iPhone, and habitually goes on her phone. To organize her events, she uses Google Calendar, and for her assignments, she writes them down on a planner.</p>
  		
  		<p><strong><em>Goals</em></strong></p>
  		<p>Athena’s current goals and top priority is doing well in her classes to have better grades. She wants to work in finance or, even more so, consulting after graduating. She wants to get more sleep. Unfortunately, wellness is not one of her top priorities at the moment because everything else seems so much more critical and demanding.</p>

  		<h2><strong>Scenarios</strong></h2> 
  		<h3>Wellness Scenario</h3>
  		<p>Jenny wakes up almost every morning at 7am and goes to the Keohane Sports Center to work out on the elliptical for 45 minutes. Three times a week, Jenny has squash practice so she instead wakes up at 6am. Her Samsung Galaxy S8 automatically logs the time that she wakes up based off of her first cell phone activity of turning off her alarm in the morning, and this data is taken from the Samsung Health App by our app. While on the elliptical, she is notified by our app to “Check-in”, and log her mood and physical condition for the day. In doing so, Jenny is prompted to take time to think about her schedule for the day, how she slept, and checks in with her thoughts and feelings. Jenny always tries to start her day on a positive note, so she can set the tone for the rest of the day. She takes 15 minutes to stretch afterwards, and returns to Quad for breakfast at Pomeroy. Jenny usually has eggs, spinach, and potatoes in the morning with tea. This food is logged in her Samsung Health app, as she does normally, and the data travels to our app. She then returns to her room in Shafer to shower and get ready for the academic day. After her morning classes. Jenny eats lunch with her friends in Lulu. Jenny had fewer vegetable servings than she usually does in the morning, so the app notifies her to eat more at lunchtime. She usually has whatever meat they’re serving in the dining hall there, along with a small salad and a glass of water. Her afternoon classes pass, and Jenny finds that she has some free time. The app knows this because it has her calendar data from Google Calendar, her usual calendaring app, and notifies her: “You have some free time! Do something for yourself with this opportunity.” Jenny takes this hint and goes to find her friends’ rooms and spend some time with them. She eats dinner with her friends, and goes back to her room to do homework. After homework, Jenny checks in with herself again, and after about 2 hours, is notified by the app to take a break to stretch. Jenny takes 20 minutes to separate herself from schoolwork. Usually she does yoga, but sometimes she meditates or rests her eyes. When all her work is done, she gets ready for bed. At 11pm, she goes to sleep, which her phone automatically records with her last cell phone activity, and the app takes this data from Samsung Health as well.</p>
  		<p>&nbsp;</p>
  		<h3>Sleep Scenario</h3>
  		<p>Helen is a sophomore at Wellesley College who constantly struggles with getting enough sleep. She takes 5 classes, one of which is at MIT, so she has to take the 7 am bus to MIT on every weekday. She currently sleeps for around 6 hours per night. She typically goes to bed at 11:00 pm - midnight and wakes up at 6 am. Ideally, Helen would like to sleep for 8 hours per night. She has difficulty falling asleep, as she has a roommate that tends to do homework at a late hour. In the morning, she takes a class at MIT and later takes the bus back to Wellesley. In the afternoon, she takes her classes at Wellesley. Last night, Helen only received 5 hours of sleep and feels that her sleep deprivation is preventing her from being able to fully concentrate in class. After class, she works, attends meetings for student organizations, and studies.</p>
  		<p>Helen is familiar with social media and mobile apps. The night before, on the Wellness app, Helen entered in her nighttime habits and sleep disturbances. She also fills in information about her ideal goal of getting 8 hours of sleep. She imports her google calendar, which contains information about her daily schedule. Helen then receives a suggested nighttime routine with actions she should complete that has incorporated her google calendar information. Helen’s quality of sleep, waking times, and sleeping times are tracked by the app, as it takes data from Samsung Health.</p>
  		<p>During the day, Helen receives several reminders from the app regarding actions she take that will help her get more sleep and sleep better during the night. At night, Helen follows the routine suggested by the Wellness app. She gets tips on relaxing before bedtime every night. She enters any relevant information that the app asks regarding her nighttime routine. The feedback that Helen receives from the app is tailored based on the information she provides, as well as the information on the amount and quality of her sleep that the app collects.</p>
  		<p>&nbsp;</p>
  		<h3>Managing Time Scenario</h3>
  		<p>Chloe faces difficulty completing her assignments on time and keeping track of her assignments and deadlines while trying to find the time for wellness. As a result, she becomes stressed frequently. To manage her time more effectively, she recently started creating her tasks, prioritizing them, and then inputting them into her google calendar in order to track and manage them. Although this helped her manage her assignments, she still struggled with prioritizing her wellness. To combat her stress, she downloaded our wellness app which a friend recommended to her as a great tool that manages the time for wellness for you. She seamlessly imported her google calendar into the app, and the app automatically found small periods of time in her schedule for the wellness activities of her choice. Because she is constantly on the go and takes many classes, she altered the specifications of the amount of time for her wellness activity and type of activity to just 5 minutes of breathing exercises. Now, the app quickly finds 5 minute periods throughout her weeks and notifies her when she has 5 minutes free for a quick breathing exercise. Usually, these 5 minutes occur right before each of her classes as she is standing outside the classroom door waiting for her next class. Utilizing these 5 minutes have been life changing for her because not only has her anxiety decreased, but also these 5 minutes would have otherwise been wasted. This app is incredibly important to her because sometimes when she is stressed, she forgets completely about her well-being, so the notification reminders have helped prioritize time for wellness for her without her forgetting, and the app has quickly become a virtual, personal best friend who is always there to support her.</p>
