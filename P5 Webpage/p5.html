	<h2>New User Onboarding</h2>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong><em>Onboarding Flow Summary</em></strong></p>
	<p>The Wellness app’s onboarding flow takes the Features approach and consists of four steps: </p>
	<p>Welcome Page -> Gmail Connection -> Notifications On/Off -> Calendar Page Entry</p>
	<p>The main goal of the Wellness app is to incorporate more wellness practices into the daily lives of Wellesley students, and promote overall mental and emotional health. In order to perpetuate this goal, we decided as a team that it would be in the user’s best interest to have the shortest possible onboarding flow, with minimum work that doesn’t cause unnecessary stress. Therefore, the Features approach was the ideal way for us to conduct our onboarding flow, where we first describe the functionality of the app on the Welcome page, then the Google Calendar on the Gmail Connection page, and finally the benefits of notifications on the Notifications On/Off page. With our three-step onboarding flow, the app only asks for the necessary information: the user’s Gmail account and whether they want notifications. Once the Gmail account is connected, the app does all the work for them on importing their Google calendars and inserting wellness breaks. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h2>Usability Testing</h2>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
	<h3><strong>Protocol</strong></h3>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<h4>1. Warm-up </h4>
	<p>This is an app intended for Wellesley students to incorporate wellness into their hectic schedules. The way that this is accomplished is through linking your Google calendar to the program so that it can automatically insert “wellness breaks” into your free time. Users can specify features of these wellness breaks, including the activity, daily frequency, and length of the break. The app also provides feedback based on the user’s check-in and tracks the user’s mood. </p>

	<ul><strong><em>Warm-up questions:</em></strong>
	<li>What do you know about self-care?</li>
	<li>Do you prioritize self-care and wellness in your life at Wellesley?</li>
	<li>In your opinion, does the Wellesley campus life encourage wellness? Why or why not?</li>
	<li>Would you like to see more promotion of wellness at Wellesley?</li>
	<li>Do you practice wellness? If so, how do you practice wellness? If not, would you like to start practicing wellness?</li>
	<li>How often do you practice wellness?</li>
	<li>Do you have face difficulty finding time to fit wellness into your schedule? Why or why not?</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>2. System Description</h4>
	<p>After observing the general Wellesley student body, most students face heavy stress and are constantly busy, thereby neglecting time to practice wellness. The purpose of our system is to help users, who may have difficulty finding time in their schedules to practice self-care or are unaware of the benefits of self-care, promote and fit wellness into their daily lives. This is done by integrating the user’s Google Calendar into the system, which automatically finds free time in the user’s calendar to schedule wellness breaks. The user can customize the characteristics of their wellness breaks and targets, making the breaks more effective and appealing. To allow for self-awareness, the app also enables the user to be mindful of how they have been feeling by enabling mood check-ins and tracking them. If the system notices that the user has not been feeling well recently or has neglected to practice their wellness exercises, the system will send notifications to the user as a reminder to take care of themselves.<p>

	<h4>3. Tasks </h4>
		<ol>
	<li>Log in to the app: Enter in your gmail address on the home page and log in successfully. </li>
	<li>Customize wellness breaks: Fill out the forms on the Targets page and save this information, and then go back to your calendar to see the breaks added in.</li>
	<li>Provide mood data: On the Check-ins page, select the emoji that best represents your mood for the day and reflect on your mood history in the graph below. Note that only the first two emoticons have been programmed to respond to the user, so you should select only the sad and/or open-mouthed excited emoji. </li>
		</ol>
	<h4>4. Wrap-up </h4>

	<ul><strong><em>Wrap-up questions:</em></strong>
	<li>Did you find the information that the user provides on the Targets page to be relevant to the goals of this app?</li>
	<li>Did you find the check-ins page of the app to be intuitive? Do you find this mood data to be helpful as something to reflect upon?</li>
	<li>Was it easy to create and customize wellness breaks using the input provided on the Targets page?</li>
	<li>Did you find the documentation provided in the Instructions page to be easy to understand for a first-time user?</li>
	<li>Do you have any further comments regarding usability or suggestions for improvement of this app?</li>
	<li>Do you think using this app would help with your overall wellness?</li>
	</ul>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<ul>	<h3><strong>Takeaways</strong></h3>
	<li>We tested three users: Marie, Silvia, and Edilia. Each user was a Wellesley student who matched characteristics of our personas that we identified in a previous project section, and the three users spanned different class years and majors. Based on their responses to our warm-up questions, users found self-care to be important but found difficulty prioritizing wellness and incorporating wellness into their daily schedules. </li>
	<li>Overall, using our system was pretty seamless for most user tests. Our users were able to easily recognize icons in the tab bar and navigate to the correct pages to complete the tasks. In general, users found customizing wellness breaks to be an intuitive process. </li>
	<li>After testing the system, all users stated that they do think the app would help with their overall wellness. </li>
	<li>Some users had different behaviors of how they use their Google calendar. For example, Marie sometimes puts events that she may not actually go to in her calendar, whereas Silvia and Edilia actively utilize their calendars. Although this is the case, it would still be best to input the wellness breaks into users’ calendars so that they at least are reminded of the break when they view their calendars and are given the choice to practice it.</li>
	<li>Instructions did not seem necessary for our particular users, as they found the app intuitive, but they thought it should still be there</li>
	<li>No features (check-ins, calendars, etc.) felt irrelevant to the users in terms of aiding the main goal of promoting wellness in their lives</li>
	<li>When the users brought up certain problems, they were satisfied with our prepared solutions. For example, Edilia was concerned about what she would do if a wellness break was scheduled while she was occupied with something else. When we proposed that she could delay the break in the app, she expressed relief.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<ul>	<h3><strong>Team Recommendations for Future Improvement</strong></h3>
	<li>Make the Instructions more like a Help page, so it’s there for those who really need it.</li>
	<li>Allowing for wellness break customization for individual practice types. For example, having 10 minute breaks for running and 5 minute breaks for meditation. </li>
	<li>Specify that when wellness breaks are 3x a day, whether is 3x of each activity chosen or overall 3x for the day.</li>
	<li>Make the scheduling “smart” so it can add wellness break right after certain activities rather than random white spaces</li>
	<li>Give users the option to schedule their own wellness breaks if they do not want the system to schedule it for them.</li>
	</ul>
